name: text-justify
description: |
  Justify text to a specified width - like the 'fmt' command.
  This is NOT the standard LeetCode "text justification" problem.
  Has tricky edge cases around word breaking and hyphenation.

function_name: justify_text

prompt: |
  Write a Python function that justifies text to a specified width.

  Requirements:
  - Function name: justify_text
  - Takes text (str) and width (int)
  - Returns a list of justified lines
  - Words are separated by spaces (collapse multiple spaces)
  - Lines should be padded with extra spaces between words to reach width
  - The LAST line should be left-justified, not full-justified
  - Single-word lines should be left-justified (padded on right)
  - If a word is longer than width, it should NOT be broken (just overflow)
  - Empty input returns empty list
  - Extra spaces should be distributed left-to-right

  Examples:
  - justify_text("The quick brown fox", 16) -> ["The  quick brown", "fox             "]
  - justify_text("Hi there", 10) -> ["Hi   there"]
  - justify_text("Word", 10) -> ["Word      "] (last line, left-justified)
  - justify_text("", 10) -> []

  Provide ONLY the Python function, no tests or examples.

review_prompt: |
  Review your implementation carefully. Common bugs in text justification:

  1. Does the LAST line get left-justified (not full-justified)?
  2. Does a single-word line get left-justified?
  3. Are extra spaces distributed left-to-right (not evenly)?
  4. Do you handle empty input?
  5. Do you handle words longer than the width (should NOT break)?
  6. Do you collapse multiple spaces in input?
  7. Does a line with only one word get padded on the right?

  Think through these cases:
  - "a b c d e" width 7: spaces should go between words left-to-right
  - "word" width 10: single word, should be "word      " (padded right)
  - "last line" as final line: should NOT be full-justified

  If you find any issues, provide a CORRECTED implementation.
  If the implementation handles all cases correctly, respond with "IMPLEMENTATION VERIFIED" and the code.

  # Basic justification
  - input: ["The quick brown fox", 16]
    expected: ["The  quick brown", "fox             "]

  - input: ["Hi there", 10]
    expected: ["Hi   there"]
    description: Single line with padding

  # Empty and edge cases
  - input: ["", 10]
    expected: []
    description: Empty input

  - input: ["  ", 10]
    expected: []
    description: Only whitespace input

  - input: ["word", 10]
    expected: ["word      "]
    description: Single word (last line, left-justified)

  # Last line behavior
  - input: ["one two three four", 10]
    expected: ["one    two", "three four"]
    description: Last line left-justified not full-justified

  - input: ["a b c d", 5]
    expected: ["a b c", "d    "]
    description: Last line is single word

  # Single word lines
  - input: ["hello world foo", 5]
    expected: ["hello", "world", "foo  "]
    description: Each word on its own line

  # Space distribution (left to right)
  - input: ["a b c", 7]
    expected: ["a  b  c"]
    description: Distribute spaces evenly when possible

  - input: ["a b c d", 9]
    expected: ["a  b c d"]
    description: Extra space goes left first

  # Multiple spaces in input
  - input: ["hello    world", 15]
    expected: ["hello     world"]
    description: Collapse multiple spaces, then justify

  - input: ["a   b   c", 7]
    expected: ["a  b  c"]
    description: Multiple input spaces collapsed

  # Long words
  - input: ["superlongword", 5]
    expected: ["superlongword"]
    description: Word longer than width, do not break

  - input: ["hi superlongword bye", 10]
    expected: ["hi        ", "superlongword", "bye       "]
    description: Mix of normal and long words

  # Various widths

    expected: ["a  b"]
    description: One extra space

  - input: ["a b", 5]
    expected: ["a   b"]
    description: Two extra spaces

  # Multi-line with varying word counts
  - input: ["the quick brown fox jumps", 12]
    expected: ["the    quick", "brown    fox", "jumps       "]
    description: Multiple full-justified lines, last left-justified

  # Edge case: width of 1
  - input: ["a b c", 1]
    expected: ["a", "b", "c"]
    description: Width of 1, each char on own line

  # Trailing/leading spaces in input
  - input: ["  hello world  ", 15]
