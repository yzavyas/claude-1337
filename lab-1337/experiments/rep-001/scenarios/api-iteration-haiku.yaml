# Scenario: API-Level Iteration with Haiku
# Tests: Does conversation-based iteration help/hurt?

name: api-iteration-haiku
description: Test API multi-turn iteration with Haiku model

hypothesis: |
  Multi-turn API conversation with test feedback should help
  the model fix errors by seeing what went wrong.

model: haiku

tasks:
  - interval-merging  # Easy baseline (expect ~100%)
  - text-justify      # Harder task (expect ~60%)

agents:
  - single-shot       # Baseline - no iteration
  - ralph-iteration   # Same prompt repeated

runs_per_agent: 3

# Results location
results_dir: results/

# What we found
findings: |
  - Single-shot outperformed test-feedback on easy task
  - Iteration made harder task worse (12/20 → 0/20)
  - Haiku may lack capability to iterate effectively
