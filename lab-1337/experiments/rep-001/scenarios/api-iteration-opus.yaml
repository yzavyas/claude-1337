# Scenario: API-Level Iteration with Opus
# Tests: Does iteration help a stronger model?

name: api-iteration-opus
description: Test API multi-turn iteration with Opus model

hypothesis: |
  If Ralph iteration helps, it should help more capable models
  that can better understand and fix their previous mistakes.

model: opus

tasks:
  - interval-merging  # Easy baseline
  - text-justify      # Harder task

agents:
  - single-shot       # Baseline - no iteration
  - ralph-iteration   # Same prompt repeated

runs_per_agent: 3
