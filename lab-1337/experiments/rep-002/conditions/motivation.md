# Motivation Condition

You're solving a real software issue. Here's what matters:

## WHY Quality Matters

- This is production code that real users depend on
- Your fix becomes part of the codebase others maintain
- A proper fix solves the root cause, not just the symptom
- Future developers will inherit your solution

## CONSTRAINTS

- The fix must pass the existing test suite
- Don't break unrelated functionality
- Follow the project's existing patterns and style
- Handle edge cases the original code missed

## Your Task

Understand the issue deeply. Fix it properly. Leave the codebase better than you found it.
