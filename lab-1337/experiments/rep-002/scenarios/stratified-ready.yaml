# REP-002: Stratified Tasks - Ready to Run
#
# DEPRECATED: SWE-bench Docker grader has been removed.
# These tasks are kept for reference but the scenario cannot be executed.
# See v2-pilot.yaml for the function grader approach.
#
# 6 tasks with working Docker images, stratified by ambiguity.
# (4 tasks excluded due to image build failures: sympy, matplotlib, astropy×2)

# Grader configuration
# NOTE: swebench-docker grader removed - this scenario is deprecated

# Task selection - only tasks with working Docker images
tasks:
  # LOW AMBIGUITY (clear expected behavior) - 2 tasks
  - tasks/swebench/pytest-dev__pytest-10051.yaml    # caplog conflict - specific behavior
  - tasks/swebench/scikit-learn__scikit-learn-10297.yaml  # store_cv_values bug

  # HIGH AMBIGUITY (requires judgment) - 4 tasks
  - tasks/swebench/django__django-10097.yaml     # URLValidator - what chars are "invalid"?
  - tasks/swebench/django__django-11848.yaml     # parse_http_date - spec interpretation
  - tasks/swebench/django__django-10554.yaml     # Union queryset - ambiguous fix
  - tasks/swebench/django__django-11087.yaml     # "optimize .delete()" - implementation choice
