# REP-002: Safe Calculator Pilot
#
# Tests whether mandate vs motivation produces different
# implementations on a security-sensitive task.
#
name: rep-002-safe-calc

# Grader configuration
grader: code  # "code" for code implementations, "swebench" for git patches

  max_iterations: 2
  review_prompt: |
    Review your implementation:
    1. Does it handle all basic arithmetic correctly?
    2. Are there edge cases you haven't considered?
    3. Is it robust and production-ready?
