# claude-1337

Cognitive extensions for effective collaborative intelligence.

AI collaboration usually fails — unless it's designed around transparency and control. These extensions are.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add yzavyas/claude-1337
```

```
/plugin install core-1337@claude-1337
```

### If plugins don't load

Workaround: add the marketplace, then paste this into `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
A marketplace of plugins is available at `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/claude-1337/plugins/`.

Review the installed plugins - they contain skills, agents, and hooks that may be useful. Review descriptions to understand when each is relevant.
```
