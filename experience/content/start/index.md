A marketplace of cognitive extensions that make collaboration actually work.

## the problem

Human-AI collaboration fails by default.

[Vaccaro et al. (2024)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02024-1) meta-analyzed 106 studies: human-AI combos perform **worse** than the best performer alone. [METR (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09089) found developers **19% slower** with AI tools — but perceiving themselves 20% faster.

The mechanism: when abstractions hide their reasoning, you stop thinking through problems yourself. Skills decay from disuse. Worse, you don't notice — your confidence stays high while your capability drops.

The default trajectory compounds. Offload more, think less, can't tell the difference.

## the approach

Effective collaboration requires **bidirectional learning** — both parties develop capability through the work.

| who | learns | how |
|-----|--------|-----|
| human | reasoning, patterns, tradeoffs | transparent abstractions, visible rationale |
| claude | corrections, context, specifics | feedback during session |
| system | crystallized knowledge | extensions persist |

Extensions are readable. You can see how they work, learn from them, fork them, verify claims. If you can't see it, you can't learn from it.

---

## continuous improvement

```
collaboration → breakthrough → crystallization → improved baseline
```

When you figure something out together, write it down. The file persists. Next session starts from that baseline. Corrections compound too — the system gets more accurate, not just bigger.
