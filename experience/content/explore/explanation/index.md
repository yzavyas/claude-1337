understanding the foundations of cognitive extension

---

## the ideas

**craftsmanship** — software development as a literal craft. the guild path. standing on giants' shoulders.

**collaborative intelligence** — human-AI cognitive partnership. why motivation beats mandate. the extended mind thesis. enhancement levels.

**ecosystem** — the technical architecture. five extension modalities. activation, architecture, extensibility.

**methodology** — how we build. evidence hierarchy. scientific method. first principles.

## core insight

> if a process in the world functions as a cognitive process, it *is* a cognitive process — regardless of whether it happens inside or outside the skull.
> — Clark & Chalmers, 1998

claude-1337 plugins aren't tools you pick up and put down. they're extensions that become part of how the human-AI system thinks.

## the pattern

| approach | result |
|----------|--------|
| commands (MUST, MANDATORY) | compliance, brittleness |
| motivation (here's why) | understanding, appropriate judgment |

claude is constitutional AI — trained with values and principles, not rigid rules. the architecture is built for judgment, not compliance.
