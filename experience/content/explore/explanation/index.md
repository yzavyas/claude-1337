# explanation

Understanding why cognitive extensions work and how to build them well.

---

## what we're building toward

Engineering excellence through effective collaborative intelligence.

Extensions that make you better — not just faster, but more capable even when the extension isn't available.

## topics

**[stakes](/explore/explanation/stakes/)** — why this matters now. the divergence, the evidence, the way forward.

**[collaborative intelligence](/explore/explanation/collaborative-intelligence/)** — the research. why motivation beats mandate. extended mind thesis. evidence for what works.

**[craftsmanship](/explore/explanation/craftsmanship/)** — software development as craft. how to evaluate claims (tooling claims need production evidence; methodology claims need research). reasoning from fundamentals while building on what experts have learned.

**[ecosystem](/explore/explanation/ecosystem/)** — technical architecture. five extension modalities. how activation works.

**[principles](/explore/explanation/principles/)** — design principles. what makes an extension enhance rather than replace capability.

## core insight

Clark and Chalmers' 1998 paper "The Extended Mind" posed a question that shapes this entire project: if something outside your head does the same cognitive work as something inside your head, is there a meaningful difference?

> if a process in the world functions as a cognitive process, it *is* a cognitive process — regardless of whether it happens inside or outside the skull.
> — Clark & Chalmers, 1998

These plugins aren't tools you pick up and put down. They're extensions that become part of how the human-AI system thinks.

## the pattern

| approach | result |
|----------|--------|
| commands (MUST, MANDATORY) | compliance, brittleness |
| motivation (here's why) | understanding, appropriate judgment |

Claude is constitutional AI — trained with values and principles, not rigid rules. The architecture is built for judgment, not compliance.
