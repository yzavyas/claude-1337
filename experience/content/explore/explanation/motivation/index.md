Why cognitive extension design matters now.

---

## the divergence

AI capability is increasing faster than our frameworks for using it well.

The foundations we establish now compound — in either direction:

| trajectory | pattern | outcome |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **complementary** | engage, learn, improve | capability accumulates |
| **substitutive** | offload, consume, depend | capability atrophies |

The same technology, different trajectories. The divergence accelerates.

## the evidence

Research shows the slope:

| finding | source | implication |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **r = -0.75** correlation: AI use vs critical thinking | Gerlich 2025 | Strong negative relationship |
| **20%** skill degradation in 3 months | Lancet 2025 | Decay is rapid |
| **83%** couldn't recall AI-assisted work | MIT 2025 | Cognitive debt accumulates |
| **g = -0.23** human-AI teams vs best alone | Vaccaro 2024 | Synergy is rare by default |

These aren't plateau effects. They're slope indicators.

## the perception gap

METR (2025) found developers:
- **19% slower** with AI assistance (actual)
- **20% faster** (perceived)
- **39 point** perception-reality gap

You can't course-correct if you don't know you're drifting.

## what determines outcome

Blaurock et al. (2024) identified five design features:

| feature | effect | implication |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **transparency** | strong | show reasoning, not just conclusions |
| **process control** | strong | user shapes how |
| **outcome control** | strong | user shapes what |
| **reciprocity** | strong | both improve through collaboration |
| **engagement** | weak/none | asking questions isn't enough |

Transparency and control enable enhancement. Engagement alone doesn't.

## the way forward

Design for mutual enhancement:

**show reasoning** — "Use X because Y" woven in, not separable footnotes. Reasoning transfers understanding automatically.

**provide frameworks** — decision frameworks, not decisions. The user can explain to others what was done and why.

**enable validation** — claims traceable to sources. Trust calibrated through verification.

**preserve agency** — both parties retain judgment. Motivation beats mandate.

---

## compounding

Every extension is a small vote for the trajectory.

Good patterns compound toward enhancement — each cycle builds capability that persists.

Bad patterns compound toward dependency — each cycle deepens the gap.

The extensions we build establish the default. The default becomes the norm. The norm shapes what's possible.
