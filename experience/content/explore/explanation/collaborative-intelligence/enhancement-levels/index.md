# enhancement levels

Three levels of cognitive integration with AI.

---

## the spectrum

| level | description | outcome |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **augmentation** | AI assists human cognition | faster, more accurate |
| **extension** | AI becomes part of cognitive system | new reach, same thinking |
| **enhancement** | system thinks in new ways | qualitatively different |

Most AI tools stay at level 1. Good extensions achieve level 2. **Enhanced collaborative intelligence aspires to level 3.**

## augmentation (level 1)

AI assists but remains external.

| examples |
|----------|
| spell check |
| code completion |
| search results |
| translation |

The human thinks. AI handles tedious parts. Cognition stays in the human's head.

---

## extension (level 2)

AI becomes part of how you think.

| examples |
|----------|
| IDE with integrated AI |
| SKILL.md as crystallized knowledge |
| search that shapes what questions you ask |

The boundary between "my thinking" and "tool I use" blurs. Otto's notebook becomes part of Otto's memory (Clark & Chalmers).

**The parity principle**: If it were done in the head, we'd call it cognition. When external but functionally equivalent, it's cognitive extension.

## enhancement (level 3)

The combination produces capability neither had alone.

| not enhancement | enhancement |
|-----------------|-------------|
| AI finds information faster | human develops intuitions they couldn't form alone |
| AI handles tedious parts | together they explore solution spaces neither conceived |
| AI suggests options human evaluates | the collaboration produces capability that didn't exist |

Enhancement is **emergent** — new capability from the combination.

---

## evidence

The MIT meta-analysis (Vaccaro et al., 2024) found:

| condition | performance |
|-----------|-------------|
| human alone | baseline |
| AI alone | varies by task |
| human + AI | often **worse** than best alone (g = -0.23) |

Synergy is rare. Most human-AI collaboration is additive (level 1), not multiplicative (level 3).

**Design implication**: Don't assume collaboration helps. Design specifically for enhancement.

## the three types (2025 research)

From cognitive extension research:

| type | effect on user | goal |
|------|----------------|------|
| **complementary** | better WITH and WITHOUT tool | skill building |
| **constitutive** | enables impossible tasks | capability extension |
| **substitutive** | worse without tool | **avoid** |

Extensions should be complementary. The user should be more capable even when the extension isn't available.

## implications for design

| level | design approach |
|-------|-----------------|
| augmentation | make AI assistance available |
| extension | integrate AI into workflow, reduce friction |
| enhancement | design for emergent capability, preserve human judgment |

Enhancement requires:
- transparency (user understands AI reasoning)
- control (user shapes process and outcome)
- reciprocity (both improve through collaboration)
