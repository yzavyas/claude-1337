## five extension modalities

| modality | purpose | what it extends |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **skill** | knowledge + decision frameworks | what Claude knows |
| **hook** | event-triggered actions | session behavior |
| **agent** | specialized subprocesses | reasoning delegation |
| **command** | workflow shortcuts | repeatable procedures |
| **mcp** | external system integration | reach beyond Claude |
