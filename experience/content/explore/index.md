## the diátaxis framework

this documentation follows the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework:

- **tutorials** — learning-oriented, step-by-step
- **how-to guides** — task-oriented, practical
- **explanation** — understanding-oriented, conceptual
- **reference** — information-oriented, factual

each serves a different user need. tutorials for learning. how-to for doing. explanation for understanding. reference for looking up.
