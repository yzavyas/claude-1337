## skill philosophy

Before building, understand the 1337 approach:

- **Best-in-class only** - no catalogs, pick winners
- **Evidence over opinion** - production usage > GitHub stars
- **Decision frameworks** - not reference docs Claude already knows
- **Tight descriptions** - explicit triggers, front-loaded keywords

See [1337-skill-creator](../reference/1337-skill-creator/) for the full methodology.

## tutorial format

All tutorials follow this structure:

1. **Goal** - what you'll build
2. **Prerequisites** - what you need installed
3. **Steps** - numbered, concrete actions
4. **Verify** - how to confirm it works
5. **Next** - where to go from here

No fluff. No "you might want to". Just: do this, then that, done.
