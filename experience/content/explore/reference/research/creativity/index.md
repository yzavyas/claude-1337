Creativity and diversity effects in AI collaboration.

---

## the creativity paradox

**Science Advances (2024).** Generative AI and creative diversity.

| dimension | effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Individual** creativity | Enhanced |
| **Collective** diversity | Reduced |
| Anchoring on AI ideas | Reduces exploration |

The paradox: AI helps individuals but homogenizes groups.

## meta-analysis findings

**Tang et al. (2024)** meta-analysis:

| model | creative advantage |
|-------|-------------------|
| GPT-4 | d = 0.41 (moderate) |
| GPT-3.5 | d = 0.18 (small) |

| dimension | who excels |
|-----------|-----------|
| Fluency (quantity) | AI |
| Diversity (variety) | Humans |

## distributed cognition

**Riedl, Savage, & Zvelebilova (2024).** AI as social forcefield.

AI shapes:
- How people **speak**
- How they **think**
- What they **attend to**
- How they **relate** to each other

| effect | valence |
|--------|---------|
| Enables efficient collaboration | Positive |
| Can erode epistemic diversity | Negative |
| Can undermine natural alignment | Negative |

> "AI not merely as a tool but as a social forcefield that reorganizes distributed dynamics of collective intelligence."

## design implications

| principle | implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Preserve diversity | Provide options, not single answers |
| Avoid anchoring | Present alternatives, tradeoffs |
| Enable exploration | Decision frameworks over decisions |
| Maintain human creativity | Patterns as starting points |

**Core principle:** Skills should expand possibility space, not constrain it.
