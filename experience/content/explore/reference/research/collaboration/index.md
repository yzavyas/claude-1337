# collaboration

Human-AI collaboration performance research.

## the meta-analysis

**Vaccaro, Almaatouq, & Malone (2024).** When combinations of humans and AI are useful. *Nature Human Behaviour*.

- 106 experimental studies, 370 effect sizes
- Preregistered systematic review (highest methodological rigor)

| finding | implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Human-AI combos often perform **worse** than best alone (g = -0.23) | Don't assume collaboration helps |
| **Content creation**: performance gains | Skills for writing, building, creating |
| **Decision-making**: performance losses | Avoid skills that make decisions |
| Synergy is rare; augmentation is common | Design for augmentation |

> "There's a prevailing assumption that integrating AI into a process will always help performance — but we show that that isn't true."

## task type matters

| task type | outcome | skill design |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Content creation | **gains** | Patterns, templates, reference |
| Decision-making | **losses** | Frameworks, NOT decisions |
| Subtask assistance | **gains** | Specific subtasks, not workflows |

## motivation and autonomy

**Scientific Reports (Nature), 2025.** Human-AI collaboration and intrinsic motivation.

- N = 3,562 participants across four studies

| finding | implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Immediate performance enhanced | Short-term gains are real |
| Gains **don't transfer** to solo work | Dependency risk |
| Intrinsic motivation **decreases** | Over-reliance harms long-term |
| Control sense increases when leaving AI | Autonomy matters |

**Theoretical basis:** Self-determination theory — intrinsic motivation requires autonomy, competence, relatedness.

## co-creation vs editing

**Scientific Reports (Nature), 2024.** Co-creation and self-efficacy in AI collaboration.

| role | creativity outcome |
|------|-------------------|
| **Editing** AI output | Creativity deficit |
| **Co-creating** with AI | Deficit dissipates |

The key: people must be **co-creators**, not **editors**.

## design implications

| principle | implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Preserve autonomy | Skills provide knowledge, user decides |
| Enable co-creation | Decision frameworks, not decisions |
| Avoid dependency | Don't do things user should learn |
| Maintain competence | Explain patterns, don't just apply |

**Core principle:** Skills should make users more capable, not more dependent.
