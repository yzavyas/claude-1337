Software development specific research.

## productivity measurement

**Ziegler et al. (2024).** GitHub Copilot productivity. *Communications of the ACM*.

| finding | implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Productivity is **multidimensional** | Can't summarize with single metric |
| Experienced developers less likely to write "better" code | Expertise affects benefit |
| Junior developers: higher perceived gains | Skill level matters |
| Acceptance rate varies by expertise | One size doesn't fit all |

## the METR study

**METR (2025).** AI impact on experienced open-source developers.

RCT with 16 experienced developers:

| metric | finding |
|--------|---------|
| Actual speed | **19% slower** with AI |
| Perceived speed | **20% faster** |
| Gap | 39 percentage points |

The perception-reality gap is substantial.

## metacognitive skills matter

**ACM ICER (2025).** GitHub Copilot and computing students.

| metacognitive skills | AI assistance outcome |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Strong | Enhanced performance |
| Weak | **Negatively impacted** |

Students who couldn't evaluate AI output were harmed by AI assistance.

## design implications

| principle | implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Skill-appropriate assistance | Different patterns for different expertise |
| Metacognitive support | Explain "why", not just "what" |
| Avoid deskilling | Don't bypass foundational understanding |
| Context-aware | Brownfield vs greenfield considerations |

**Core principle:** Skills should augment existing capability, not substitute for learning.
