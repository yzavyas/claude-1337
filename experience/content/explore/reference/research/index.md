# research

What does research actually say about human-AI collaboration? The findings shape everything we build here.

## key findings

| finding | source | implication |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Human-AI combos often **worse** than best alone | Vaccaro 2024 | Design for augmentation, not replacement |
| Content creation gains, decision-making losses | Vaccaro 2024 | Provide frameworks, not decisions |
| r = -0.75: AI use vs critical thinking | Gerlich 2025 | Preserve engagement and judgment |
| 20% skill degradation in 3 months | Budzyń Lancet 2025 | Skill decay is rapid |
| 83% couldn't recall their AI-assisted writing | Kosmyna MIT 2025 | Cognitive debt accumulates fast |
| Individual creativity ↑, collective diversity ↓ | Doshi 2024 | Homogenization risk at scale |

## design principles

From the research, principles emerge in priority order:

### foundational (non-negotiable)

| principle | research basis |
|-----------|---------------|
| **augment, don't replace** | Vaccaro 2024: synergy is rare |
| **preserve autonomy** | SDT 2025: autonomy drives motivation |
| **enable co-creation** | Nature 2024: co-creation beats editing |

### trust (critical for adoption)

| principle | research basis |
|-----------|---------------|
| **enable validation** | CHI 2021: validation beats acceptance |
| **calibrate reliance** | CHB 2024: over-reliance harms |
| **maintain critical thinking** | Gerlich 2025: r = -0.75 correlation |

### growth (long-term capability)

| principle | research basis |
|-----------|---------------|
| **support metacognition** | ICER 2025: skills determine benefit |
| **preserve diversity** | Science Advances 2024: collective risk |
| **avoid dependency** | Nature 2025: gains don't transfer |
