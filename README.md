# claude-1337

Skills for Claude Code built by researching what production teams actually use, then distilling it into decision frameworks instead of tutorials.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add yzavyas/claude-1337
```

## Skills

See [docs/](docs/).

## How these were built

1. Research what tools/patterns ship in production (not just GitHub stars)
2. Triage: cut anything Claude already knows, keep the non-obvious stuff
3. Format as decision tables, not prose explanations
4. Split into SKILL.md (always loaded) and references/ (loaded when needed)

The methodology is documented in the `1337-skill-creator` skill.
