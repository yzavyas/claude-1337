## How these were built

1. **Learn** from domain experts, core maintainers, and reputable technical blogs
2. **Validate** against production codebases — what actually ships, not just what's popular
3. **Distill** — cut what Claude already knows, keep non-obvious decisions and gotchas
4. **Format** as decision tables, not prose explanations

The methodology is documented in `1337-skill-creator`.
