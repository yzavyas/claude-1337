Teaching methodology for elite documentation.

"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." - Richard Feynman

## What's Inside

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Skill | Teaching principles - Diataxis, Feynman technique, anti-patterns |
| Agent: `feynman` | Autonomous documentation workflow |
| Hook | SessionStart activation for teaching mode |

## The Feynman Agent

Invoke `sensei-1337:feynman` to produce documentation following the Feynman technique:

1. **Understand** - Research the domain, identify audience
2. **Simplify** - Structure with progressive disclosure
3. **Teach** - Examples first, no jargon
4. **Refine** - Cut ruthlessly, read aloud

## When to Use

- Writing concept explanations
- Creating tutorials or how-tos
- Drafting READMEs
- Building learning materials

## Philosophy

Standard docs explain. Elite docs **teach**.

| Standard | Elite |
|----------|-------|
| Wall of text | Scannable structure |
| Theory first | Example first |
| Comprehensive | Focused |
| Assumes knowledge | Builds knowledge |
