# Cognitive Load Theory

John Sweller's framework for understanding learning constraints.

## The Three Types

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Intrinsic | Inherent complexity of the material | Recursion is harder than loops |
| Extraneous | Load from poor instructional design | Confusing layout, unclear terms |
| Germane | Productive effort building mental models | Making connections, understanding why |

Total cognitive load = Intrinsic + Extraneous + Germane

Working memory is limited. When total load exceeds capacity, learning fails.

## Design Implications

### Reduce Extraneous Load

| Technique | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Consistent structure | Same format across similar content |
| Eliminate redundancy | Don't repeat info in text and diagram |
| Spatial contiguity | Related info close together |
| Temporal contiguity | Related info at same time |
| Signaling | Cues that highlight organization |

### Manage Intrinsic Load

Can't reduce complexity of subject, but can sequence it:

1. Start with low element interactivity (isolated concepts)
2. Build to high element interactivity (concepts that must be understood together)
3. Provide worked examples before problem-solving

### Maximize Germane Load

Once extraneous is minimized:
- Encourage self-explanation
- Use varied examples (promotes abstraction)
- Interleave related concepts (strengthens discrimination)

## The Worked Example Effect

Novices learn better from studying solved examples than from solving problems themselves.

Why: Problem-solving requires search, which consumes working memory. Worked examples let learners focus on understanding the solution pattern.

When to use: Early in learning. As expertise develops, problem-solving becomes more effective (expertise reversal effect).

## Expertise Reversal Effect

What helps novices can hurt experts:
- Novices need scaffolding, guidance, worked examples
- Experts find the same scaffolding redundant and distracting

Design implication: Progressive removal of scaffolding as learner advances.
