# AI Writing Anti-Patterns

Patterns to avoid in technical documentation. From research on AI content detection and technical writing best practices.

## Why This Matters

LLM-generated text has measurable statistical signatures. Readers pattern-match "AI slop" and disengage. If teaching requires trust and engagement, AI tell-tales undermine the goal before content is even read.

The core problem is uniformity. AI models cluster tightly in stylometric analysis. Human writers show far greater range. The writing sounds like it could have been written by anyone—or no one.

## Vocabulary

### Tier 1: Instant Red Flags

| word | replace with | why |
|------|--------------|-----|
| delve | explore, examine, look at | 25x increase post-ChatGPT |
| leverage | use | corporate filler |
| tapestry | (delete) | AI favorite metaphor |
| robust | strong, reliable, solid | unless technical meaning |
| utilize | use | always |
| aforementioned | this, that, the | archaic filler |
| meticulous | careful, thorough | overused intensifier |

### Tier 2: Empty Superlatives

cutting-edge, groundbreaking, innovative, revolutionary, game-changer, transformative, state-of-the-art, best-in-class, unprecedented

Rule: if you use these, prove them with specifics immediately.

### Tier 3: Filler Adjectives

crucial, pivotal, paramount, fundamental, essential, significant, comprehensive, holistic, synergistic, seamless

These add length not meaning. Delete or replace with concrete detail.

## Structural Anti-Patterns

### Rule of Three Abuse

LLMs overuse triadic structures: "X is fast, reliable, and efficient"

Fix: vary rhythm. Sometimes one point is enough. Sometimes five.

### Bullet Point Infestation

AI prefers bullets to prose. Lists are for genuinely parallel items. Prose is for explanation.

### Uniform Paragraph Length

AI produces eerily consistent paragraph sizes. Human writing has short punchy paragraphs, longer exploratory ones, single-sentence emphasis.

### Em-Dash Overuse

AI pattern: "This solution—unlike traditional approaches—delivers results."

Human pattern: em dashes appear naturally, not formulaically.

### Excessive Bold

AI bolds mechanically: every **key term** is **bolded** in a **key takeaways** fashion.

Human pattern: emphasis is rare and meaningful.

## Tone Anti-Patterns

### The Overly Formal Robot

Never uses contractions, avoids first person, passive voice everywhere. Technical docs can still sound human.

### The Relentlessly Positive Sycophant

"This excellent approach..." Never acknowledging limitations. Be direct. State limitations. Criticize when warranted.

### Excessive Hedging

"It may be worth considering that..." "One could potentially argue..."

Make direct statements when you know things. Hedge only when genuinely uncertain.

### Generic Openings

- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "It's important to understand that..."
- "Let's dive into..."

Start with substance. Cut the throat-clearing.

## Content Anti-Patterns

### Lack of Specificity

AI: "The system provides excellent performance improvements."
Human: "Response times dropped from 800ms to 120ms."

Numbers, examples, and specifics beat adjectives.

### Glossing Over Hard Parts

Complex concepts mentioned but not explained. Hand-waves with "simply" or "easily". Explain the hard parts—that's often why documentation exists.

### Low Information Density

Many words, few ideas. Repetition disguised as elaboration. Every sentence should carry new information.

## The Human Test

Before publishing:

- Could only you have written this?
- Does it reflect specific experience or knowledge?
- Would a reader recognize your voice?
