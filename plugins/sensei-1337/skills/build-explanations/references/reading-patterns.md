# How People Read Online

Research from Nielsen Norman Group eye-tracking studies.

## The F-Pattern

In 2006, NN/g tracked 232 users across thousands of web pages. The dominant pattern resembled the letter F:

1. Horizontal sweep across the top
2. Shorter horizontal sweep below
3. Vertical scan down the left side

This pattern means:
- First two paragraphs get the most attention
- Left side of content gets scanned
- Right side often ignored
- Headings and bullets catch eyes

## Four Scanning Patterns

| Pattern | Behavior | When it happens |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| F-pattern | Top → left column scan | General browsing |
| Layer-cake | Jump between headings only | Looking for specific topic |
| Spotted | Random fixations on standout elements | Scanning for keywords |
| Commitment | Read everything | High motivation or interest |

Layer-cake (scanning headings) is the most efficient pattern aside from full reading.

## Design for Scanning

Since most readers scan:

| Technique | Why it works |
|-----------|--------------|
| Front-load keywords | First 2 words of headings matter most |
| One idea per paragraph | Lets readers skip irrelevant sections |
| Meaningful headings | "How to Install" beats "Getting Started" |
| Bullets for lists | Faster to scan than prose |
| Bold key terms | Eyes catch emphasis |

## The Inverted Pyramid

From journalism: most important information first.

```
[Key point / Conclusion]
    [Supporting details]
        [Background]
            [Nice to know]
```

Readers who leave early still get the main point.

## Wall of Text Problem

Dense paragraphs cause:
- Immediate bounce (reader leaves)
- F-scanning to find escape
- Missing important information buried in middle

Fix: Break at thought boundaries. White space is your friend.
