# Reader Psychology

How readers process technical information. Understanding cognition to design for how people actually read.

## Why This Matters

People don't read — they scan, filter, and decide in milliseconds whether to engage. Designing for how you wish they read fails. Designing for how they actually read works.

## Core Principles

### Information Foraging (Pirolli & Card)

Readers forage for information like animals forage for food. They follow **information scent** — cues that suggest relevance.

| Scent signal | Example | Effect |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| Strong scent | Clear heading, relevant keywords | Reader continues |
| Weak scent | Vague title, jargon | Reader bounces |
| False scent | Clickbait that doesn't deliver | Reader loses trust |

**Implication**: Every heading, link, and paragraph opening must signal relevance clearly.

### Processing Fluency (Schwarz & Oppenheimer)

Easy-to-read feels more credible. This is not laziness — it's how cognition works.

| Factor | Effect on credibility |
|--------|----------------------|
| Simple language | Higher perceived truth |
| Clean typography | Higher perceived quality |
| Familiar structure | Lower cognitive load |

**Implication**: Plain language makes content credible.

### Dual Processing (Kahneman)

Two systems process information:

| System | Speed | Effort | Use case |
|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| System 1 | Fast | Automatic | Scanning, first impressions |
| System 2 | Slow | Effortful | Deep reading, analysis |

**Implication**: Design for System 1 first (clear headings, visual hierarchy). Only those who pass the System 1 filter engage System 2.

### Cognitive Load (Sweller)

Working memory is limited (~4 items). Three types of load:

| Type | Source | Your job |
|------|--------|----------|
| Intrinsic | Complexity of material | Sequence appropriately |
| Extraneous | Poor design, clutter | Minimize ruthlessly |
| Germane | Learning and integration | Protect and enable |

**The evidence**: Removing extraneous material improves learning (Mayer coherence principle: d = 0.86).

## Role-Based Processing

Different roles read differently:

### Decision-Makers

| Behavior | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| Scan for bottom line | Lead with conclusion (BLUF) |
| Time-constrained | 30-second version essential |
| Risk-focused | Surface risks and mitigations early |
| ROI-seeking | Quantify benefits |

### Practitioners

| Behavior | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| Task-focused | "How do I do X?" |
| Want recipes | Steps, not theory |
| Copy-paste oriented | Working examples |
| Error-recovery seeking | Troubleshooting sections |

### Evaluators

| Behavior | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| Methodology-focused | Show your work |
| Source-seeking | Cite everything |
| Skeptical by default | Acknowledge limitations |
| Evidence-comparing | Provide context for claims |

### Learners

| Behavior | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| Building mental models | Scaffold from simple |
| Need context | Explain why, not just what |
| Benefit from examples | Concrete before abstract |
| Progressive disclosure | Don't overwhelm |

## Research Summary

| Finding | Effect Size | Source |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Plain language comprehension | +20-47% | Mindlin 2012 |
| Text structure instruction | g = 0.95 | Pyle et al. 2017 |
| Coherence (remove extraneous) | d = 0.86 | Mayer 2009 |
| Worked examples | g = 0.48 | Barbieri et al. 2023 |
| Signaling | d = 0.46 | Mayer 2009 |
| Concrete vs abstract recall | 2x | Paivio dual coding |

## Application

1. **Strong scent** — Every heading signals relevance clearly
2. **Simple first** — Plain language for System 1 filtering
3. **Role-aware** — Different sections for different readers
4. **Low extraneous load** — Remove everything unnecessary
5. **Scaffold** — Build from concrete to abstract
