# Audience Empathy

Understanding who you're teaching — their mental models, concerns, and language.

## Why This Matters

Rhetoric and structure are tools. Applied without understanding the audience, they're just technique. True accessibility comes from understanding the reader: what they already believe, what they fear, what language they speak, what would make them want to change.

## Functional Audience Types

Different people arrive with different needs. One explanation doesn't fit all.

### By Role

| Role | Primary concern | Needs from you | Language |
|------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| Decision-maker | Risk and returns | Business case, defensible choice | ROI, competitive advantage, risk mitigation |
| Practitioner | Getting work done | Actionable guidance, recipes | Technical, concrete, "show me" |
| Evaluator | Due diligence | Evidence, methodology | Citations, effect sizes, methodology |
| Learner | Building understanding | Scaffolded progression | Simple first, jargon defined |

### By Expertise Level

| Level | Characteristics | What helps | What hurts |
|-------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| Novice | No mental model yet | Scaffolding, worked examples, hand-holding | Assumed knowledge, jargon |
| Competent | Has basic model, gaps remain | Fill specific gaps, correct misconceptions | Starting from zero, over-explaining basics |
| Expert | Strong mental model | New information, edge cases, nuance | Explaining what they know, condescension |

**The expertise reversal effect** (Sweller): What helps novices hurts experts. Scaffolding that aids beginners becomes distracting redundancy for experts.

See: [cognitive-load.md](cognitive-load.md) for details on expertise reversal.

## The Empathy Framework

For each audience, understand:

| Question | Why it matters |
|----------|----------------|
| What do they already believe? | You start from their map, not yours |
| What do they fear? | Resistance often comes from fear |
| What do they value? | Connect to what they care about |
| What language do they use? | Wrong words signal "not for me" |
| What would make them want to change? | Motivation, not mandate |

### Applied to Common Roles

**Decision-maker:**
- Believes: ROI matters, time is scarce
- Fears: Wasted investment, looking foolish to stakeholders
- Values: Outcomes, efficiency, competitive position
- Language: Dollars, percentages, risk, market
- Changes when: Cost of inaction is clear in their terms

**Practitioner:**
- Believes: They're competent at their craft
- Fears: Being replaced, being told they've been wrong
- Values: Craft, effectiveness, respect for expertise
- Language: Technical, concrete, examples
- Changes when: It makes them better, not threatened

**Evaluator:**
- Believes: Claims need proof
- Fears: Being fooled by hype
- Values: Rigor, truth, methodology
- Language: Citations, sample sizes, effect sizes
- Changes when: Evidence meets their standards

**Learner:**
- Believes: They can improve
- Fears: Looking stupid, being overwhelmed
- Values: Growth, clarity, encouragement
- Language: Simple, building blocks
- Changes when: Path is clear and achievable

## Gauging Audience from Context

In conversation or when context is available, look for signals:

### Expertise Signals

| Signal | Likely level | Adjust by |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Uses domain jargon correctly | Competent+ | Skip basics, use technical terms |
| Asks foundational questions | Novice | Define terms, provide scaffolding |
| Points out edge cases | Expert | Engage with nuance, acknowledge complexity |
| Mixes terminology | Competent with gaps | Fill specific gaps, don't over-explain |

### Role Signals

| Signal | Likely role | Adjust by |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Asks "what's the ROI?" | Decision-maker | Lead with business impact |
| Asks "how do I do X?" | Practitioner | Give the recipe |
| Asks "what's the evidence?" | Evaluator | Provide methodology and citations |
| Asks "can you explain X?" | Learner | Scaffold from simple to complex |

### Engagement Signals

| Signal | Meaning | Adjust by |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Short responses | Losing interest or overwhelmed | Simplify, get to the point |
| Follow-up questions | Engaged, wants more | Go deeper |
| Pushback | Resistance or expertise | Acknowledge their point, adjust frame |
| Silence | Could be processing or lost | Check understanding |

## Progressive Disclosure by Audience

Match depth to need:

| Audience | Give them | Then offer |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Decision-maker | The bottom line (30 sec) | Link to business case details |
| Practitioner | The recipe (5 min) | Link to explanation of why |
| Evaluator | The evidence summary | Link to full methodology |
| Learner | The simple version | Path to go deeper |

Each layer is a complete answer for that audience. Nobody should have to read more than they need.

## Diataxis Mapped to Audience

| Diataxis type | Primary audience | Their state |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| Tutorial | Learner | "Teach me from scratch" |
| How-to | Practitioner | "Help me do this task" |
| Explanation | Curious expert or learner | "Help me understand why" |
| Reference | Practitioner or expert | "Give me the facts" |

Decision-makers and evaluators aren't well-served by Diataxis alone — they need the business case layer or evidence summary that doesn't fit neatly into these four types.

## The Same Message, Different Frames

Identical information, reframed for different audiences:

**The finding**: AI tools may reduce developer productivity by 19%.

| Audience | Frame |
|----------|-------|
| Decision-maker | "Your AI investment may be costing you 19% productivity. Here's the RCT data and what to do about it." |
| Practitioner | "Here's research showing AI tools can slow you down if used wrong. Here's how to use them effectively." |
| Evaluator | "METR 2025 RCT (n=16): 19% measured slowdown vs. 24% perceived speedup. Methodology and limitations here." |
| Learner | "AI tools aren't automatically helpful. Let's look at when they help and when they hurt." |

Same fact. Four different teachings.
