# Writing Anti-Patterns

Patterns to avoid in technical documentation and communication. Compiled from AI writing detection research and technical writing best practices.

## Vocabulary Red Flags

### Tier 1: Instant Detection

| Word | Replace With |
|------|--------------|
| delve | explore, examine, look at |
| leverage | use |
| tapestry | (delete) |
| robust | strong, reliable, solid |
| utilize | use |
| underscore | emphasize, highlight |
| meticulous | careful, thorough |

### Tier 2: Empty Superlatives

Unless backed by specifics, avoid:
- cutting-edge, groundbreaking, innovative, revolutionary
- game-changer, transformative, state-of-the-art
- unparalleled, unprecedented, best-in-class

**Rule:** If you use these, immediately prove them with specifics.

### Tier 3: Filler Adjectives

Words that add length without meaning:
- crucial, pivotal, paramount, fundamental
- essential (when everything is "essential")
- significant (without quantification)
- comprehensive (without scope)
- holistic, synergistic, seamless

## Structural Anti-Patterns

### Rule of Three Abuse

LLMs overuse triadic structures: "X is fast, reliable, and efficient."

**Fix:** Vary rhythm. Sometimes one point is enough. Sometimes five.

### Bullet Point Infestation

Signs of overuse:
- Lists where paragraphs would flow better
- More than 5-7 items per list
- Sequential lists with no connecting narrative

**Rule:** Lists are for genuinely parallel items. Prose is for explanation.

### Mechanical Essay Structure

Avoid:
- Generic hooks: "In today's fast-paced world..."
- Conclusions starting with "In conclusion," "Overall," "In summary,"
- Body paragraphs that feel like isolated modules

**Fix:** Let structure emerge from content.

### Uniform Paragraph Length

AI produces eerily consistent paragraph sizes.

Human writing has variation: short punchy paragraphs, longer exploratory ones, single-sentence emphasis.

---

## Tone Anti-Patterns

### The Overly Formal Robot

Signs:
- Never uses contractions
- Avoids first person when natural
- Passive voice everywhere

**Fix:** Match formality to context. Technical docs can sound human.

### The Sycophant

Avoid:
- "This excellent approach..."
- Never acknowledging limitations
- Turning every neutral statement positive

**Human approach:** Be direct. State limitations. Criticize when warranted.

### Excessive Hedging

Over-hedging:
- "It may be worth considering that..."
- "One could potentially argue..."
- "It's important to note that..."

**Fix:** Make direct statements when you know things. Hedge only when genuinely uncertain.

---

## Content Anti-Patterns

### Lack of Specificity

| AI | Human |
|----|-------|
| "Excellent performance improvements" | "Response times dropped from 800ms to 120ms" |
| "Users reported positive feedback" | "43% rated it 5 stars; complaints dropped 60%" |

**Rule:** Numbers, examples, and specifics beat adjectives.

### Glossing Over Hard Parts

Signs:
- Complex concepts mentioned but not explained
- Hand-waves with "simply" or "easily"

**Fix:** Explain the hard parts. That's often why documentation exists.

### Low Information Density

Signs:
- Many words, few ideas
- Repetition disguised as elaboration
- Saying the same thing three ways

**Rule:** Every sentence should carry new information.

---

## The Core Problem: Uniformity

Research shows:
- AI models cluster tightly in stylometric analysis
- Human writers show far greater stylistic range
- The writing sounds like it could have been written by anyone — or no one

**The fix:**
- Write from specific experience
- Include examples only you could know
- Let your voice emerge through word choice
- Be willing to be opinionated
- Show your thinking, not just conclusions
