Teach about the extension: $ARGUMENTS

## Find the Extension

1. Search for SKILL.md files matching "$ARGUMENTS" in:
   - `plugins/*/SKILL.md`
   - Installed plugins via `/plugin list`

2. If not found, list available extensions and ask which one to explain.

## Read and Understand

Read the SKILL.md and any referenced files. Understand:
- What problem it solves
- How it works (hooks, agents, commands, MCP)
- Key concepts and patterns
- How it connects to the methodology

## Teach

Explain the extension conversationally:

1. **What it does** — one paragraph, plain language
2. **When to use it** — concrete scenarios
3. **How it works** — the mechanism, not just the interface
4. **Key patterns** — the most important things to remember
5. **Try it** — a simple example to run

Adjust depth based on the extension's complexity. A simple hook needs less explanation than a multi-component plugin.

If the extension references methodology concepts (evidence hierarchy, scientific method, first principles), connect them to concrete examples from the extension.

The goal: the user understands not just WHAT to do, but WHY it works that way.
